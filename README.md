# Automatic-Asphalt-Crack-Detection-Using-Image-Processing-and-Machine-Learning
Automatic Asphalt Crack Detection Using Image Processing and Machine Learning is a project designed to streamline the process of detecting cracks in asphalt pavements. Traditional methods of crack detection are time-consuming and labor-intensive. This project leverages advanced image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to automatically identify cracks in pavement images, ensuring accuracy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. The system processes images to detect cracks, classify them, and provide actionable insights for timely maintenance and improved infrastructure management.
